    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is how to make these very yummy and very cute Jellycat cinnamon rolls. You would be lying if you said that you've never looked at a Jellycat and thought, "Wow! That looks so good, I wish I could eat it!". Well guess what? Now you can with this super awesome recipe!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Dough</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup fine white sugar</li>
        <li>2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>7 oz soft unsalted butter</li>
        <li>7 oz milk</li>
        <li>4.5 cups bread flour</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 tsp instant yeast</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Filling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/4 cup dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>5 oz soft unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 tsp of cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Topping</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 small tub of black decorative icing</li>
        <li>1 can of cream cheese frosting</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Making the Dough</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the ingredients in a bowl and mix for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough until smooth.</li>
        <li>Let rise in a bowl for 1 hour!</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Making the Filling</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the softened butter with brown sugar and cinnamon.</li>
        <li>Put in the fridge to cool. <em>This will make it easier to cut without spilling out much.</em></li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Putting Everything Together</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Roll out the proofed dough to about 90 x 45cm.</li>
        <li>Spread the filling on the top, not putting too much.</li>
        <li>Roll up like a snail and use a string to cut out your cinnamon rolls.</li>
        <li>Save parts of the ends of the dough to make tiny ball feet!</li>
        <li>Roll up 8 small dough balls, covering thoroughly in cocoa powder.</li>
        <li>Add the rolls and two feet to each roll.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Baking the Rolls!</h2>
    <p>Place into a square pan spaced apart plenty (I always get about 4-6 large rolls). Any larger pan size works for these, just make sure they are spaced apart. No need to proof again. Bake at 375F for about 30-35min. Decorate a face with black icing! Add cream cheese frosting to top if you like while hot! Enjoy!</p>
