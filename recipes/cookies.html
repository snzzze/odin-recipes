    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is how to make these fun, adorable, and delicious Miffy shortbread cookies!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Vanilla</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>All-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Baking powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Making the Dough</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small saucepan, melt 1/2 cup butter with 1/3 cup water.</li>
        <li>Add 1/2 cup sugar and 1/4 teaspoon salt.  Stir together.</li>
        <li>Bring mixture to a boil over low heat.</li>
        <li>Pour mixture into a mixing bowl and let stand to cool for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add 2 cups flour and 1/2 teaspoon baking powder.</li>
        <li>Begin to stir in flour mixture.</li>
        <li>Mix until the dough forms a smooth soft ball of dough.</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto the counter and quickly knead the dough until soft and smooth.</li>
        <li>Flatten the dough into a square or rectangular shape.  Wrap with plastic wrap and refrigerate dough for at least 3 hours.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Roll and Cut Miffy Shortbread Cookies</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>After 3 hours remove dough from the refrigerator and unwrap. Preheat oven to 350℉.</li>
        <li>Place the dough on a lightly floured surface or between two sheets of parchment paper. The dough is very stiff and you will need to use some upperbody strength. At first, it can be difficult to roll, but it will begin to soften up and roll easier. <strong>Roll approx 3/16-inch (between 1/8-1/4 inch).</strong></li>
        <li>Using a Miffy cookie cutter, press into the rolled out dough.  Be sure to press straight down, without wiggling the cutter back and forth.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Let's Bake!</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place on a baking sheet 1/2-inch apart. <em>Because the dough has been chilled, the cookies will not lose their shape while baking.</em></li>
        <li>Bake in a preheated 350℉ oven for 8-10 minutes or until barely beginning to brown around the edges.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Now sit back and enjoy your freshly made Miffy cookies!</p>
